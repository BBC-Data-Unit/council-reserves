# English councils warned about 'running out' of reserve cash

In May 2019 we [published analysis](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-48280272) identifying 11 authorities the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) said would have "fully exhausted" reserves within four years unless they topped them up.

The BBC analysis of [government data](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-authority-revenue-expenditure-and-financing) followed work by Cipfa, which published a "resilience" index of councils, but stopped short of naming those it warned were depleting reserves the fastest.

The analysis revealed which 11 of the 152 major English councils have used so much of their reserves since 2015 that Cipfa said they would run out within four years if spending patterns continued.

Croydon Council appeared to have spent more than half of its reserves but said the government data was "inaccurate" and its reserves "remain strong". The council has asked for them to be corrected.
